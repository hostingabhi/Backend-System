Sure, let's break down each of the tasks:

### Task 1: System Architecture Diagram

To draw the system architecture diagram, we'll need to include the following components:
- Client (e.g., a web or mobile app)
- Server (e.g., a Node.js backend)
- Queue System (e.g., RabbitMQ)
- Database (e.g., MongoDB)
- Worker Processes (e.g., background jobs)

Here is a high-level description of the architecture:

1. **Client**: Sends requests to the server.
2. **Server**: Handles client requests, processes data, and interacts with the queue system and database.
3. **Queue System**: Manages tasks that need to be processed asynchronously.
4. **Database**: Stores persistent data.
5. **Worker Processes**: Consume tasks from the queue and process them.
